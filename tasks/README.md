### tasks
You can ask the bot to perform tasks. By default no tasks are installed. Tasks are javascript (or babel ES6/7) single-file programs
installed under **./tasks** folder. To ask the bot to execute a task tell him:

```@bb-8 please <name of file without js> ...arguments you want to pass it```
